# LavaLock - Delta-Hacks XII

LavaLock is an app that scans the chaotic entropy of a lava lamp and leverages Google Gemini's API to create multiple variations of the lamp, while keeping it unchanged (additions to the background, etc.). It then takes this photo and through an industry standard cryptographic algorithm, derive a specific numerical code or password sequence for 2FA, password generation and much more. It essentially takes the chaotic randomness of the Lava Lamp for generating secure passwords, codes, etc.
